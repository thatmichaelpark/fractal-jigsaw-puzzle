<h2>Fractal Jigsaw Puzzle</h2>
<p>
In this jigsaw puzzle, the pieces are themselves puzzles made of smaller pieces. Solve the puzzles from the smallest
to the largest and end up with a nice image from the Mandelbrot set.

<ul>
<li>Blank pink pieces need to be solved. Double-click on them and get to work.</li>
<li>Red pieces are already solved and will be filled in by the computer. This process takes a few seconds per piece.</li>

<li>Press Escape if you double-click on a solved piece.</li>
<li>Your progress is saved.</li>
<li>There are <em>a lot</em> of pieces in this puzzle. I don't expect anyone to finish it.</li>
