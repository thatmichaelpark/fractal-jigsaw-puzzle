Level: draw children; fill in those that are filled in.

Zoom in:
* erase all other pieces, enlarge selected piece to x5 at center of screen
* selected piece becomes the new current level
* if selected piece is filled in, then
	There should be a large but pixelated piece on screen
	Display the children as they get filled in (which will all be in their proper places, because the level is done); this will cover the pixelated piece with high-res pieces.
	Remove pixelated piece
* else (selected piece is not filled in)
	Replace pixelated piece with high-res outline of piece.
	Display all children, fill them in.


Zoom out:
If level is done (all pieces filled in and in place):
	Shrink all children to 1/5 on screen where it was in the upper level
	Draw outline of upper level
	Replace all children with the corresponding upper-level piece after it's been filled in.
	Display the rest of the children and fill them in.

If level is not done:
	Shrink level outline to 1/5 on screen where corresponding upper-level piece will be.
